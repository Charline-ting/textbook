<p>These problems can be solved using the main ideas of Chapters 6 through 8. The material in those chapters of course relies on all the previous chapters.</p>
<p>The set of exercises is divided into two parts: The Basics, and Additional Practice. The first part will remind you of the fundamental concepts and some typical calculations. The rest are for you to further develop your problem solving skills and your fluency with the notation and ideas.</p>

<p><strong>30.</strong> Survey respondents understandably don’t like to answer questions about
sensitive topics such as illegal drug use. If data scientists want to
estimate the proportion of illegal drug users in a population, they have
to devise methods of getting the information they need while maintaining
the privacy of the individual respondents.</p>
<p>*Randomized response* schemes are often used in such situations. In
one such scheme, each surveyed person is given a coin and asked to
answer YES or NO after following these instructions out of sight of the
surveyor:</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Toss the coin.</p>
<p>$\bullet$ If it lands heads, then truthfully answer, “Do you use illegal
drugs?”</p>
<p>$\bullet$ If it lands tails, then toss it again and answer, “Did the
second toss land heads?”</p>
<p>This way each respondent answers YES or NO but the surveyor doesn’t know
which question was answered. The data scientists then have to estimate
the proportion of illegal drug users based on the overall proportion of
YES answers, which includes the YES answers to the second question.</p>
<p>Let the unknown proportion of illegal drug users in a large population
be $p$, and suppose a random sample of size $n$ is surveyed using the
scheme above. You can assume that the sampling is equivalent to drawing
at random with replacement.</p>
<p>(a) Let $X$ be the proportion of sampled people who answer YES. Find
$E(X)$.</p>
