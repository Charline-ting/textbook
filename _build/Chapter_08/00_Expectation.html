<p>The distribution of a random variable gives us detailed information about how probability is distributed over all the possible values of the variable. But often we would just like a sense of roughly where the distribution is situated on the number line. In other words, we would like some idea of where the center of the distribution is.</p>
<p>As any student who has taken multiple "midterm" exams in a class knows, words like "middle" and "center" don't have a unique meaning. This chapter is about a particular kind of "center" of the distribution of a random variable.</p>
