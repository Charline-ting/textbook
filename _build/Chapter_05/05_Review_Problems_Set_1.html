<p>These problems can be solved using the main ideas of Chapters 1 through 5. It is divided into two parts: The Basics, and Additional Practice. The first part will remind you of the fundamental concepts and some typical calculations. The rest are for you to further develop your problem solving skills and your fluency with the notation and ideas.</p>
