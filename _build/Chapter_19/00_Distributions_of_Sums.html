<p>This chapter provides some general methods for working with sums of random variables, whether discrete or continuous.</p>
<p>We will start with the continuous analog of the convolution formula for the distribution of a sum of two independent discrete random variables.</p>
<p>We will then develop a more powerful version of the probability generating function that we defined earlier to study sums of independent random variables with finitely many non-negative integer values. The new version, called the <em>moment generating function,</em> will apply to discrete as well as continuous random variables, with finite or infinite sets of possible values.</p>
