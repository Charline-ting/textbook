<p>These problems can be solved using the main ideas of Chapters 16 through 18. The Basics set will remind you of the fundamental concepts and some typical calculations. The rest are for you to further develop your problem solving skills and your fluency with the notation and ideas.</p>
<p>You can leave answers in terms of the standard normal cdf $\Phi$. You can also leave answers in terms of the Gamma function $\Gamma$ unless you are asked for a simplification.</p>

[This is Pitman 5.rev.22, with his permission]. In Maxwell's model of a gas, molecules of mass $m$ are assumed to have velocity components $V_x$, $V_y,$ and $V_z$ that are independent, with a joint distribution that is invariant under rotation of the three-dimensional coordinate system. Maxwell showed that $V_x$, $V_y$, and $V_z$ must each have the normal $(0, \sigma^2)$ distribution for some $\sigma$. Taking this result for granted:</p>
